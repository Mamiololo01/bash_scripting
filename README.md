To start scripting, create a new file with .sh extension and make the file executable with the command "chmod +x fileName"
touch bashscript.sh

Edit the script with nano or vim editor. To run the script on your terminal use the command "./fileName.sh"

You can redirect the output to another file. Once you run the script, a new file will be created and the contents too.

# Conditional statement
if and else statement.

Reference the script in cond_state.sh, which ascertains if a statement is true or not. You can edit it to suit your logic. Please always remember that the script will end with fi for an if statement.

# Case statement
Bash Case Example 1. Sending Signal to a Process
The following script accepts the signal number and process id as itâ€™s arguments, and sends the signal to a given process id using signal name.
Other 4 different examples can be seen on the casescript.sh file.


# While loop
The while loop in a Linux Bash script is a type of loop that continues to execute as long as the programmed condition remains true.
hile loops are useful when you need to repeatedly execute a set of instructions a certain number of times, or when you want to create an infinite loop.

while loops are also useful when you want to create an infinite loop. For example, if you want a loop to continue executing until the user manually hits Ctrl + C or otherwise kills the script. Or if you have a system administration script that continually checks for disk space or some other stat, for example

#For Loops

This type of for loop is characterized by counting. The range is specified by a beginning (#1) and ending number (#5). The for loop executes a sequence of commands for each member in a list of items.

Following shell script will go though all files stored in /etc directory. The for loop will be abandon when /etc/resolv.conf file found.
